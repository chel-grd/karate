<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Saskatoon Shotokan Karate Club was founded in 2010 by Sensei Philip Boutin. The club was established
as an affiliate of the International Shotokan Karate Federation, a non-profit organization which
strives to uphold the integrity and goals of Shotokan Karate's founder: Master Gichin Funakoshi.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
Master Funakoshi developed the Dojo Kun, his vision for the key principles of self-development through
karate. We recite these principles at the end of each session to emphasize their importance to our
training. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
The first ISKF dojo in Saskatchewan was founded in 1981 by Sensei Del Phillips. In 2013, Sensei Philip
Boutin was voted Saskatchewan Director for ISKF Canada and the Saskatoon Shotokan Karate Club was named the 
provincial headquarters.
</p>
<h2>Dojo Kun</h2>
<p class='dojoKun'>Seek perfection of character &#x25CF; Be faithful &#x25CF; Endeavour &#x25CF; Respect others &#x25CF; Refrain from violent behaviour</p>

</div>
<div id="aboutMe">About Me:
<p>
Sensei Phil began his karate training in 1995. Since then, he has had the opportunity
to travel and train with numereous brilliant karate minds including karate pioneers
Nishiyama, Okazaki, and Yaguchi Senseis. He continues to travel regularly to learn 
from a new generation of leading karate-ka. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
As a teenager, Phil began assisting and eventually teaching in the former Saskatchewan
provincial headquarters dojo. As a university student, he opened the Saskatoon Shotokan
Karate Club. The dojo became provincial headquarters in 2013 as Sensei Phil was named 
Saskatchewan Director for ISKF Canada. He has appeared as an invited guest instructor
across the prairie provinces.
